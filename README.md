This repository outlines personal, academic, and competitive projects contributed to by Karthik Suresh.

# Dublin Datathon
This is the submission of the 2nd place winning team at the 2018 Dublin Datathon.

The final report can be viewed [here](https://ksureshprojects.github.io/dublindatathon.html).

# Data Compression Full Technical Report
This directory contains all the files submitted as part of the full technical report for the Cambridge Engineering 3rd Year Course 3F7 (Information Theory and Coding). 

A static version of the notebook in which the analysis is conducted can be viewed [here](https://ksureshprojects.github.io/3F7FTR.html).

# Logic Simulator

This folder contains files that make up an application, which allows users to simulate digital circuits by specifying a circuit in a prescribed logic description language. The application involved three main components: a scanner to read symbols from a user's circuit specification file; a parsing engine to identify syntactic and semantic errors if they exist; and a graphical user interface to allow the user to toggle circuit configurations and simulate the behavior of circuits. 

To run this application, download the folder and run the following command:
```
python load_gui.py
```
If running the application on Mac OS, you might have to use the following command instead:
```
pythonw load_gui.py
```

For more detailed instructions please refer to the user guide included in this folder.

# Dimensionality Reduction

### Singular Value Decomposition
This notebook explores SVD as a means to reduce the dimensionality of a data set prior to the application of a machine learning method.
