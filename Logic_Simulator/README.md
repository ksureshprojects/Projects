# Logic Simulator

This folder contains files that make up an application, which allows users to simulate digital circuits by specifying a circuit in a prescribed logic description language. The application involved three main components: a scanner to read symbols from a user's circuit specification file; a parsing engine to identify syntactic and semantic errors if they exist; and a graphical user interface to allow the user to toggle circuit configurations and simulate the behavior of circuits. 

To run this application, download the folder and run the following command:
```
python load_gui.py
```
If running the application on Mac OS, you might have to use the following command instead:
```
pythonw load_gui.py
```

For more detailed instructions please refer to the user guide included in this folder.
