## Random Forests
This notebook explores Random Forest models as a means to create an accurate regression model for a non-linear dataset. A Random Forest model can also be used to create a discrete classifier see the [SVD](ksureshprojects.github.io/SVD.html) notebook for an example.

A static version of the note book can be viewed [here](ksureshprojects.github.io/RandomForests.html).
